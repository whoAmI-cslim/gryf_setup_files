    # ============================
    # Local authoritative zones and data
    # ============================

    # Define your main internal domain zone.
    # 'static' means only local-data within this zone is served; no recursion.
    # Use 'transparent' if you might have other non-local records under chiips-main.
    # If this zone is purely a container for sub-zones defined below, you might omit it.
    local-zone: "chiips-main." static

    # Define the specific subdomain zone containing 'api'
    # 'transparent' allows recursion for other potential records in this zone if needed.
    # Use 'static' if ONLY local-data should ever be served for this zone.
    local-zone: "hub.chiips-main." transparent

    # Specific A record for the API endpoint
    local-data: "api.hub.chiips-main. IN A 192.168.8.101"
    # Corresponding reverse PTR record for the API IP
    local-data-ptr: "192.168.8.101 api.hub.chiips-main."

    # --- Wildcard Domain Handling ---
    # Define the zone for wildcard subdomains under apps.hub.chiips-main.
    # 'redirect' type sends all queries for names within this zone (that are not
    # otherwise specified) to the address defined in the zone's apex local-data.
    local-zone: "apps.hub.chiips-main." redirect

    # This single A record serves as the target for the 'redirect' zone above.
    # It effectively handles *.apps.hub.chiips-main -> 192.168.8.101
    # No need to add separate local-data entries for oauth, console, grafana, etc.
    local-data: "apps.hub.chiips-main. IN A 192.168.8.101"
